\abstract{Current and future high energy physics particle colliders are capable
to provide instantaneous luminosities of 10$^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and above.
The high center of mass energy, large number of simultaneous collision of beam
particles in the experiments and the very high repetition rates of the collision
events pose huge challenges. They result in extremely high particle fluxes,
causing very high occupancies in the particle physics detectors operating at
these machines. We discuss how timing information with a precision of around 10
ps and below can aid the reconstruction of the physics events under such
challenging conditions. 

We present studies and measurements from test beams and GEANT4 simulations for
calorimeter based timing measurements to explore the ultimate timing precision
achievable for high-energy photons. We put particular focus on techniques to
measure the timing with a precision of about 10 ps in association with the
energy of the photon. We present studies with detector prototypes where we
achieve the timing resolution of a few tens of picoseconds in test beam
measurements. Finally, possible applications of precision timing in
future high-energy physics experiments are discussed. }



\section{Introduction}

The high luminosity update of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) at CERN
is expected to provide instantaneous luminosities of 10$^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$
in order to achieve, among other things, the capability to perform precision 
measurements of the Higgs couplings, to probe rare Higgs processes,
and to study the scattering of longitudinally polarized W bosons. Such a
high instantaneous luminosity comes at the price of significantly increased
amount of pileup, projected to be at an average of $140$ to $200$ simultaneous 
interactions per bunch crossing. This large amount of pileup poses serious
challenges for the ability to reconstruct events of interest, as the 
likelihood for confusion due to contamination from particles produced
in different pileup events significantly increases. The ability to
discriminate between jets produced in the event of interest,
particularly for those associated with the vector-boson fusion process,
from jets produced by pileup collisions, and the missing transverse energy
resolution are two of the most important performance benchmarks
that will be severely degraded.

One possible solution to mitigating such pileup confusion effects,
complementary to other solutions incorporating precision tracking,
is to incorporate a time of arrival measurement associated with a
particular layer of the calorimeter, allowing for a timestamp
assignment for both charged particles and photons. Such a measurement
with a precision of about $20$ to $30$~ps, when unambiguously
associated to the corresponding energy measurement, can significantly reduce
the effect of pileup particles on the reconstruction of the
event of interest as the spread in collision time of pileup events
are on the order of about $200$~ps. A crucial element is
the link between the time measurement and the energy measurement,
and therefore one ideal design is to make to time and energy
measurement in the same active detector element. It is in this context 
that we study the possibility to measure the time of arrival of 
electromagnetic particles with a calorimetric device.

To demonstrate proof of principle, we focus our studies on
measurements of the time of flight using sampling calorimeters
based on LYSO crystals. Besides the advantage of very high light
yield ($\sim 30$K photons/MeV), LYSO is also radiation tolerant and
thus is the main active element of one of the options considered 
for the CMS upgrade for the HL-LHC. In Figure~\ref{fig:ScintillatorTiming} 
we present a simplified illustration of the major contributions to the 
precision of the timing measurement using a monolithic crystal calorimeter.
Upon entering the crystal the photon converts and begins to shower,
which produces scintillation light in the crystal. The time scale
between entering the crystal and the first conversion is referred to
as $t_C$. The time scale associated with the rise time of the scintillation 
light signal and the propagation of the electromagnetic shower is denoted
by $t_S$. Typically the scintillation light is collected by a photodetector
located at the back end of the calorimeter cell. The time scale associated
with the optical transit of the scintillation light to the location of the
photodetector is denoted by $t_T$. Finally, the photo detector and
its readout system have characteristic time constants $t_P$ and $t_D$.
Each of the above time scales have fluctuations on an event-by-event
level, which contribute to the time of flight resolution.

\begin{figure}[h] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figs/ScintillatorTiming} \caption{Factors
influencing the precision of the timing measurement with a monolithic, large
scintillating crystal. The incident particle impinges on the crystal face from
the left. Characteristic times of various factors are defined in the colored
boxes and in the text.}
\label{fig:ScintillatorTiming}
\end{figure}

In past studies~\cite{MCPFastCaloNIMA}, we have measured the timing resolution
associated with the photodetectors to be
about $11$~ps, and the electronic time resolution
of the DAQ system to be about $6$~ps. By measuring the time of flight
resolution at different absorber thicknesses for electron beams with
energies varying from $12$ to $32$~GeV, we showed that the contribution
of the fluctuations of the electromagnetic shower, associated with
the time scale $t_{C}$, is less than $20$~ps. 

To complete the characterization of the time of flight resolution
for a crystal based calorimeter, we report here on the results
of studies focusing on the contributions due to fluctuations
in the scintillation process, and in the optical transit
to the photodetector.



\section{Experimental Equipment}

Several detector elements of our experimental setup are shared for 
the studies described. Two types of MCP-PMT photodetectors 
are used, one produced by Hamamatsu 
( model R3809-52 )~\cite{HamamatsuMCPPMT}, and one
produced by Photek ( model PMT240 )~\cite{Photek240}. 
A DRS4 waveform digitizer evaluation board (version 4)~\cite{DRS4} was
used as the primary DAQ system connected to a laptop via
USB interface. All experimental beam studies were performed
at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility (FTBF), which 
provided proton beams from the Fermilab Main Injector accelerator
at $120$ GeV/c, and secondary electron beams of energies ranging 
from $4$ to $32$~GeV/c. Detector elements were placed inside of a 
dark box lined with copper foil, providing RF shielding. A
$2$x$2$~$\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ scintillator is placed inside the box at
the upstream extremity and used as trigger for the DAQ readout,
providing a relatively strict constraint on the location and directionality
of the beam particles used in the time of flight studies. 
Finally, the differential Cherenkov counter located upstream
of our experimental hall is used for electron identification. 

%Maybe need some more photos of individual devices%
A schematic diagram of a typical time of flight measurement
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:TypicalSchematicDiagram}. All
measurements involve a fast photodetector which serves to
measure the reference ($t_{0}$) timestamp, typically 
an MCP-PMT, and a photodetector further downstream
that detects the signal associated with the
electromagnetic shower from which a simultaneous energy 
and time ($t_{1}$) measurement is made. 


\section{Event Selection and Analysis}

The analysis performed in these studies primarily involve
reconstructing the time of flight of beam particles
between different detector elements. Slightly different
algorithms are used for different detector elements,
but all involve the assignment of a time stamp using 
specific features of each corresponding signal pulse.
The signal pulse for the reference time detector
is typically very sharp and relatively symmetric 
around its maximum amplitude, as shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:PulseShapes}. Therefore, for the reference 
detector we determine the time position of the pulse
peak and fit a Gaussian function to the peak
of the pulse, using three sampling points before the 
pulse maximum and four sampling points after. The
mean value of the fitted Gaussian function is
assigned as the timestamp $t_{0}$. The signal pulse
for the downstream time measurement is typically
the result of scintillation light, and exhibits a 
relatively fast rising edge and a significantly slower
decay. Therefore, we assign the timestamp $t_{1}$ 
using a constant fraction fit to the rising edge.
A linear function is fitted between the sampling
points at $10\%$ and $60\%$ of the pulse maximum
and the time stamp is assigned as the time 
at $20\%$ of the pulse maximum on the fitted
linear function. Examples of fits performed to assign a 
time stamp from each pulse are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PulseFits}.
In both cases, some optimization was performed 
to arrive at the exact algorithm parameters used.

\begin{figure}[h] \centering

from an 8 GeV electron run.} 
\label{fig:PulseShapes}
\end{figure}

Event selection and pulse cleaning procedure was used to eliminate abnormal
pulses in the readout. Large signals above 500 mV were also rejected because
they saturated the DRS4 inputs. Pulses with an irregular peak profile were
rejected, as well as pulses which experienced a sudden reversal of polarity that
is occasionally observed with our DAQ system. Only pulses with amplitude 
larger than 20 mV was used for time of flight measurements in order to 
avoid any impact of the noise from the DRS waveform digitizer DAQ system. 
Events containing more than one pulse within our readout window of 200 ns 
were not used.

\section{Time of Flight in LYSO Crystal-based Calorimeters}

As we discussed in the introduction, this article describes studies
focused on the characterization of two of the five main aspects
driving the time of flight resolution: scintillation and 
optical transport. Stochastic processes in the scintillation
mechanism and the randomization of the optical paths for the 
scintillation light to reach the location of the photodetector 
affect both the speed of the signal formation
as well as the time jitter. We characterize the impact of
these two effects on the time of flight resolution using
two independent experimental setups which isolates the
two components. To study the effect of scintillation
we perform time of flight resolution measurements
for electron beams using a sampling calorimeter composed of a 
$(1.7\mathrm{ cm})^{3}$ LYSO cube as the active 
scintillating element behind about 4 radiation lengths of lead. 
The effect of optical transport is studied by measuring
the time of flight resolution using a shashlik 
calorimeter composed of alternating layers of tungsten
and LYSO, with scintillation light signal extracted
through wavelength shifting fibers as well as 
through direct optical coupling to the edges of a few
LYSO layers. 


\subsection{Studies of Time Jitter from Scintillation}

We study the impact of the scintillation mechanism in LYSO
on the time of flight resolution using a simple 
sampling calorimeter composed of a layer of
lead, about $4.5$ radiation lengths in thickness, acting
as a radiator and a LYSO crystal cube with linear dimensions 
of $1.7$~cm. The LYSO crystal is wrapped in Tyvek and  
coupled with optical grease to a Hamamatsu R3809 MCP-PMT
which is used to extract the scintillation photon signal. 
A Photek 240 MCP is placed upstream of the calorimeter and 
is used to measure the reference time. A schematic diagram
and a photograph of the experimental setup
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:LYSOSamplingCaloSetup}. 
The contribution of optical transit effects on the 
time of flight resolution is minimized as the linear
dimensions of the cube is relatively small.

\begin{figure}[h] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figs/LYSOSamplingCaloSetupSchematic} 
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figs/LYSOSamplingCaloSetupPhoto} 
\caption{ A schematic diagram of the experimental setup for the
time of flight measurement using the LYSO sampling calorimeter
is shown, along with a photograph of the experimental setup. } 
\label{fig:LYSOSamplingCaloSetup}
\end{figure}

A plastic scintillator, approximately $2$~mm by $2$~mm in cross sectional area
and placed upstream of the reference time detector, is used to trigger
the DAQ readout on the DRS waveform digitizer and ensures that any
time of flight measurement is constrained to within a $2$~mm region,
which limits the time jitter due to the geometry to about $12$~ps. 
Electron events were identified by requiring a signal with amplitude
larger than $10$~mV in the Cherenkov counter.
Finally, large lead bricks are placed upstream of the Hamamatsu
R3809 MCP-PMT but out of the beam to provide shielding of the photodetector
from stray particles produced from events where an electromagnetic shower
occurs elsewhere upstream of the lead radiator. Such stray shower
events yield very fast signals which can significantly contaminate the
scintillation signal if uncontrolled. Using the identical
experimental setup but without the LYSO active element in place,
we found that stray shower type events yield less than $10\%$ contamination
and gives a negligible effect on the scintillation signal. The same calorimeter
setup using the Photek 240 MCP in place of the Hamamatsu R3809 MCP-PMT,
which has an active area about $10$ times larger, was found to yield 
more than $80\%$ contamination and thus did not result in a proper
measurements of the scintillation signal.

Despite the thickness of the LYSO active element layer being relatively
small and therefore only capturing a fraction of the total energy
of the electron, the location of the active element is relatively close to the
shower maximum for electromagnetic showers, and yields
a reasonable energy measurement. In Figure~\ref{fig:LYSOCubeEnergy32GeV}
we show the distribution of the pulse integral for events
measured by this sampling calorimeter produced with a
$32$~GeV electron beam, and find a resolution of about $20\%$.


\begin{figure}[h] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figs/TOF_Electron_LYSOCube_32GeV_energy} 
\caption{ Histogram of the pulse integral for events recorded using
the LYSO cube sampling calorimeter for a $32$~GeV electron beam. } 
\label{fig:LYSOCubeEnergy32GeV}
\end{figure}

The time of flight measurement was performed using the LYSO sampling calorimeter
for electron beams with energies varying from $4$~GeV to $32$~GeV. The 
measured time of flight distributions are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:LYSOCubeTOF}.
We achieve the best time of flight resolution of $34$~ps for electrons
with beam energy of $32$~GeV.

\begin{figure}[h] \centering

\caption{ Time of flight distributions for the LYSO cube sampling calorimeter
for electron beams with varying beam energies. } 
\label{fig:LYSOCubeTOF}
\end{figure}

The time of flight resolution measurements are plotted as a function of the
beam energy in Figure~\ref{fig:LYSOCubeTOFResolutionVsEnergy}, and is observed
to follow a $1/\sqrt{E}$ dependence. We fit the result to the sum of a 
$1/\sqrt{E}$ term and a constant term, and determine the constant term to
be about $11$~ps with an uncertainty of about $30\%$. 

\begin{figure}[h] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figs/TimeResolutionVsEnergy_CrystalCube} 
\caption{ The time of flight resolution measured using the LYSO cube
sampling calorimeter is plotted as a function of the electron beam energy, 
and fitted to the sum of a $1/\sqrt{E}$ term and a constant term. }
\label{fig:LYSOCubeTOFResolutionVsEnergy}
\end{figure}

Given that we control the combined contribution to the time of flight
resolution of the electromagnetic shower
fluctuations, the photodetector time resolution, and the DAQ electronics
to about $25$~ps~\cite{MCPFastCaloNIMA} and that the geometric contribution 
from the transverse size of the trigger is about $12$~ps,
we infer that the contribution of the scintillation mechanism in LYSO
to the time of flight resolution is less than $20$~ps.


\subsection{Studies of Time Jitter from Optical Transport}

We study the contribution to the time of flight resolution due to
various forms of optical transport in the context of a LYSO-tungsten Shashlik
calorimeter, one of the proposed choices for the Phase 2 upgrade of the
CMS endcap calorimeter system. We compare the time of flight resolution
performance for two alternative optical transport schemes. 

We begin with a conventional scheme where scintillation light is collected
by wavelength shifting fibers through a set of four holes penetrating 
the LYSO layers. A schematic diagram and a photograph showing this setup 
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ShashlikFiberSetup}. 
MCP photomultiplier tubes produed by Hamamatsu (R3809) are used to collect 
the scintillation light, while a Photek 240 MCP is used as the reference 
time detector. 


\begin{figure}[h] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figs/ShashlikFiberSetupSchematic} 
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figs/ShashlikFiberSetupPhoto} 
\caption{ A schematic diagram of the experimental setup for the
time of flight measurement using the LYSO-tungsten shashlik calorimeter
with fiber signal extraction is shown, along with a photograph of the
experimental setup. } 
\label{fig:ShashlikFiberSetup}
\end{figure}

In addition to effects of light transport along the fiber, 
this scheme has the added effect of absorption and re-emission as 
the scintillation light enters the wavelength shifting material. 
The characteristic time scales involved in the wavelength shifting 
mechanism may affect the rise time and time jitter of the final signal 
pulse. We investigate this particular effect in greater detail by
comparing the signal pulses obtained using two different types
of wavelength shifting fiber in the same LYSO-tungsten shashlik
calorimeter. In Figure~\ref{fig:FiberPulseComparison} we show
the pulse shapes averaged over a few hundred events obtained 
using DSB1 fibers and Y11 fibers, plotted in blue and red respectively,
compared with the average pulse shape obtained from direct optical 
coupling to the edge of one of the LYSO tiles, plotted in green.
We find that the rise time of the pulse shape obtained using the 
DSB1 fibers, at about $3.5$~ns, is significantly faster than the rise time
of the pulse obtained using the Y11 fibers, which is about $10$~ns,
and is within a factor of two of the rise time for the pulse obtained 
through direct optical coupling to the photodetector. This indicates
that the choice of fiber is an important parameter for 
optimizing the time of flight resolution for the design of 
this type of calorimeter, and that the DSB1 fibers 
already provides a reasonably good choice.

\begin{figure}[h] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figs/FiberPulses} 
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figs/FiberPulsesZoom} 
\caption{ Pulse shapes digitized by the DRS4 board and averaged over several hundred events 
obtained from the LYSO-tungsten shashlik calorimeter with light extracted using
DSB1 (blue) and Y11 (red) wavelength shifting fibers, are compared with 
the averaged pulse shapes obtained from direct coupling of the photodetector (green)
to one edge of one of the LYSO tiles in the shashlik calorimeter.} 
\label{fig:FiberPulseComparison}
\end{figure}


Using the DSB1 fibers, we measure the time of flight resolution
for electron beams with beam energy varying between $4$~GeV and $32$~GeV.
In Figure~\ref{fig:ShashlikFiberEnergy32GeV} we show the distribution
of the pulse integral, a quantity proportional to the measured energy,
for the $32$~GeV beam and observe an energy resolution of about $5\%$.
The time of flight distributions, fitted to gaussian functions,
are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ShashlikFiberTOF}, and the resulting
$\sigma$ parameter of the gaussian is plotted as a function of the
beam energy in Figure~\ref{fig:ShashlikFiberTOFResolutionVsEnergy}.
We find that the dependence of the time of flight resolution on
beam energy exhibits a $1/\sqrt{E}$ functional form, indicating
that the current calorimeter setup remains in the photo-statistics
limited regime. The best time of flight resolution we obtain
with this setup is about $110$~ps. As the measurement is photo-statistics
limited, to improve on this result in the future, work is needed
on improving the light collection efficiency.

\caption{ Histogram of the pulse integral for events recorded using

and background is visible in the spectrum as a result. } 
\label{fig:ShashlikFiberEnergy32GeV}

calorimeter with signal extracted using DSB1 fibers is plotted as a function of
the electron beam energy, and fitted to a $1/\sqrt{E}$ functional form. }
\label{fig:ShashlikFiberTOFResolutionVsEnergy}
\end{figure}


Next, we studied an alternative scheme where the MCP photodetectors
are directly coupled to the edge of two subsequent LYSO layers of the
shashlik calorimeter and scintillation light is directly transported 
to the photodetector through the edge of the tile layers. 
A schematic diagram and photographs showing the exposed edge
of the LYSO layers and the setup is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ShashlikSideReadout}.

\begin{figure}[h] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figs/ShashlikSideReadoutSetupSchematic} 
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figs/ShashlikSideReadoutPhotoA} 
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figs/ShashlikSideReadoutPhotoB} 
\caption{ A schematic diagram of the experimental setup for the
time of flight measurement using the LYSO-tungsten shashlik calorimeter
with signal extraction from the edges of two LYSO layers is shown. Photographs
of the exposed edges of the LYSO layers and the full experimental setup is shown. } 
\label{fig:ShashlikSideReadoutSetup}
\end{figure}

With the intention to study the relationship between the impact of the 
optical transit time jitter and the impact of limited photostatitics,
we minimize the distance that the scintillation light
must travel to reach the photodetector in this setup and thereby minimize the
impact of optical transit on the time resolution, but reduce the photostatistics 
as we collect light from only a fraction of the edges of two LYSO layers. 
In Figure~\ref{fig:ShashlikSideReadoutTOF}, we show the 
time of flight distributions for electron beams at various energies, 
fitted to gaussian functions. The resulting
$\sigma$ parameter of the gaussian is plotted as a function of the
beam energy in Figure~\ref{fig:ShashlikSideReadoutTOFResolutionVsEnergy}.
The best time of flight resolution that we obtain is about $55$~ps, and
fitting the result to the sum of a $1/\sqrt{E}$ term and a constant term,
we find a constant term of about $30$~ps with an uncertainty of $30\%$. 

\begin{figure}[h] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figs/TOF_ShashlikSideReadout_Electron_8GeV} 
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figs/TOF_ShashlikSideReadout_Electron_16GeV}

\caption{ Time of flight distributions for the LYSO-tungsten shashlik calorimeter

\label{fig:ShashlikSideReadoutTOF}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figs/TimeResolutionVsEnergy_ShashlikSideReadout} 
\caption{ The time of flight resolution measured using the LYSO-tungsten shashlik calorimeter

\label{fig:ShashlikSideReadoutTOFResolutionVsEnergy}
\end{figure}

In summary, we find that removing the impact of the wavelength shifting mechanism
and minimizing the impact of the optical transit does indeed improve the time
of flight resolution, but at a cost in photostatistics. Results obtained in this
experiment suggest that the LYSO-tungsten shashlik calorimeter with edge
signal readout design can likely achieve a $30$~ps resolution provided 
some improvement to light collection is achieved.
